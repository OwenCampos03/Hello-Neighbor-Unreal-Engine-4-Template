Nicky player is already in the project, all set up!
Here's a quick rundown of how to set up objects for it:
1. When making a new object, you do it exactly how you would for the original player.
2. All you have to set up in addition to the socket variable is the animations.
3. To edit the animations, you first open the new object BP you made, go to "Animations" in the "Properties" tab, and change the all accordingly.


That's really it! Hope y'all like the new version of the template :)
